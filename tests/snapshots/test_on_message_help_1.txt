`!lfg [size:N] [@player-1] [@player-2] ... [~tag-1] [~tag-2] ...`
>  Join or create a pending game for players to join.
> 
> The default game size is 4 but you can change it by adding, for example, `size:2` to create a two player game.
> 
> You can automatically invite players to the game by @ mentioning them in the command. They will be sent invite confirmations and the game won't be posted to the channel until they've responded.
> 
> Players will be able to join or leave the game by reacting to the message that SpellBot sends with the ➕ and ➖ emoji.
> 
> Up to five tags can be given as well to help describe the game expereince that you want. For example you might send `!lfg ~no-combo ~proxy` which will assign the tags `no-combo` and `proxy` to your game. People will be able to see what tags are set on your game when they are looking for games to join.

>
