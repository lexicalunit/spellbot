`!queue [size:N] [@player-1] [@player-2] ... [~tag-1] [~tag-2] ...`
>  Add a player to an admin controller play queue. _Requires the "SpellBot Admin" role._
> 
> This command works in a similar way as !lfg, however it is intended to be used by event runners to add players to a special game queue. For example if they have paid for access to an on-demand event.
> 
> I recommend that you run this command in a channel that players don't have access to view so that the game post that SpellBot makes can't be interacted with by players.

> Aliases: `!signup`
