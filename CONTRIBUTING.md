# Contributing

This bot is developed for Python 3.7+ and it is built on top of the
[`discord.py`](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library.

It uses [`poetry`](usage) to manage dependencies. To install development
dependencies use: `poetry install`. This will allow you to run
[PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and the included scripts.

You can install `poetry` with `pip`:

```shell
pip install poetry
```

## Installing the application

Install in development mode via `poetry`:

```shell
poetry install
```

> **Note:** On some systems such as most Linux ones you may also need to install
> `python3-venv` using your system's package manager as `poetry` depends on it.

## Running the application

Make sure that you have [set up your environmental variables](/README.md#-running-spellbot-yourself).

If you wish, you can use a [.env file](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/). Copy the `.env.example` file to get started.

When your environmental variables are set, run:

```shell
poetry run spellbot --help
```

This will list some useful flags you can provide to run SpellBot. To get started developing, run:

```shell
poetry run spellbot --dev
```

This will start SpellBot and reload it whenever the source code changes.

## Running tests

We use [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage test execution.
It can be installed with `pip`:

```shell
pip install tox
```

Whenever you ran the `poetry install` command for the first time it created a
virtual environment for you based on which python environment you installed
`poetry` into.

Our `tox` configuration has tests set to run against multiple python
environments. So you will need to manage multiple installs of python to be able
to support testing in multiple environments. Thankfully
[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and
[`tox-pyenv`](https://pypi.org/project/tox-pyenv/) make this straightforward and
seamless.

First [install `pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) on your
machine. There are various methods to do this, some easier than others. On macOS
I'd use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and for other systems I, and the author of
`pyenv`, recommend
[`pyenv-installer`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer).

Now install [`tox-pyenv`](https://pypi.org/project/tox-pyenv/) so that `tox` can
automatically find your environments:

```shell
pip install tox-pyenv
```

Now let's create the python environments you'll need. The following commands
will do this on any *NIX system. For other systems hopefully what I'm doing here
is instructive. Details on each command are given with inline comments.

```shell
# install a plugin that allows pyenv to know how to fetch the latest versions
git clone https://github.com/momo-lab/xxenv-latest.git "$(pyenv root)"/plugins/xxenv-latest

# for each python environment in the tox configuration, create it using pyenv
# this step takes a while, but you will only need to do this setup once
tox -l | while read -r py; do
    # translate a tox env name like "py37" into a number like "37"
    number="$(echo "$py" | sed "s/^py//")"

    # translate a number like "37" into a python version like "3.7"
    version="${number:0:1}.${number:1:1}"

    # install the latest python interpreter for that version
    pyenv latest install "$version"
done

# configure tox-pyenv to use the interpreters we just installed
pyenv local $(pyenv versions --bare | tr '\n' ' ')
```

The above script, **at the time of this writing**, amounts to running the
following three commands:

```shell
pyenv install 3.7.6
pyenv install 3.8.1
pyenv local 3.7.6 3.8.1
```

But over time newer versions of python will become available and the above
script should automatically handle that for you.

> **Note:** If your `pyenv install` command fails, please read
> [this](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/common-build-problems) help
> documentation provided by `pyenv`. You probably need to install some
> prerequisites on your system using your system's package manager.

Now you should be able to run the entire test suite against all python
environments with:

```shell
tox
```

Or a specific set of tests and environment. For example all tests pertaining to
users using the `py37` environment:

```shell
tox -e py37 -- -k user
```

After running the _full test suite_ you can view code coverage reports in the
`coverage` directory broken out by python environment.

```shell
open coverage/py37/index.html
```

## Running tests against different databases

If you want to run the tests against something other than the default sqlite
database, you can set the environment variable `TEST_SPELLBOT_DB_URL` and the
tests will attempt to connect to your database using that connection string.
The tests will not use the normal `SPELLBOT_DB_URL` variable. This is to prevent
the test suite from possibly blowing away your user data by connecting to
whatever database you have configured via `SPELLBOT_DB_URL`.

## Formatting and linting

Codebase consistency is maintained by the industry standard [black][black]. For
linting we use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) with configuration
to work alongside the formatter. Imports are kept in order by
[isort](https://timothycrosley.github.io/isort/). The included test suite can
run these tools against the codebase and report on any errors:

```shell
tox -- -k codebase
```

## Updating test snapshots

We also use [pytest-snapshot](https://github.com/joseph-roitman/pytest-snapshot)
to generate and test against snapshots. To generate new snapshots pass
`--snapshot-update` to your `pytest` command. For example, from the root of this
repository:

```shell
poetry run pytest -k your_test_function --snapshot-update
```

Where `your_test_function` is the name of the test you'd like to update.

## Release process

There's two methods for doing a release. You can use a script to handle
everything for you automatically, or you can basically do every step in that
script manually. Both methods are described below but I recommend the script.

### Scripted

To do a release automatically there is a *NIX script available in the `scripts`
directory to help. To use it you will need to have non-interactive
`poetry publish` enabled by running:

```shell
poetry config pypi-token.pypi "YOUR-PYPI-TOKEN-GOES-HERE"
```

If you don't have one, you can create your PyPI token for this command by going
to the
[PyPI settings for spellbot](https://pypi.org/manage/project/spellbot/settings/)
and clicking on the `Create a token for spellbot` button there. Of course you
will have to be a collaborator for this project on PyPI to be able to do this.
Contact [amy@lexicalunit.com](mailto:amy@lexicalunit.com) to be added to the
project.

Once you have that set up, you can release a new version by running:

```shell
scripts/publish.sh [major|minor|patch]
```

You must select either `major`, `minor`, or `patch` as the release kind. Please
follow [semver](https://semver.org/) for guidance on what kind of release to
make. But basically:

- Major: Breaking changes.
- Minor: New features.
- Patch: Bug fixes.

### Manually

To release a new version of `spellbot`, use `poetry`:

```shell
poetry version [major|minor|patch]
tox # verify that all tests pass for all environments
# edit the CHANGELOG.md file to promote all unlreased changes to the new version
poetry build
git commit -am "Release vM.N.P"
poetry publish
git tag 'vM.N.P'
git push --tags origin master
```

> **Note:** The reason you should run `tox` after running the `poetry version`
> command is to ensure that all test still pass after the version is updated.

You can get the `M.N.P` version numbers from `pyproject.toml` after you've run
the `poetry version` command. On a *NIX shell you could also get it automatically like so:

```shell
grep "^version" < pyproject.toml | cut -d= -f2 | sed 's/"//g;s/ //g;s/^/v/;'
```

When you use the `poetry publish` command you will be prompted for your
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/) credentials.

After publishing you can view the package at its
[pypi.org project page](https://pypi.org/project/spellbot/) to see that
everything looks good.

## Database migrations

We use [alembic][alembic] for database migrations. It can detect changes you've
made compared to an existing database and generate migration scripts necessary
to apply _and_ reverse those changes. First, make the changes to the data
models. Alembic can detect differences between an existing database and changes
made to the models. To autogenerate migration scripts that will bring the
database inline with the changes you've made to the models, run:

```shell
poetry run scripts/create_db_revision.py \
    "<your-sqlalchemy-database-url>" \
    "<Some description of your changes>"
```

This will create a revision script in the `src/spellbot/versions/versions`
directory with a name like `REVISIONID_some_description_of_your_changes.py`.
You may have to edit this script manually to ensure that it is correct as
the autogenerate facility of `alembic revision` is not perfect, especially
if you are using sqlite which doesn't support many database features.

## Heroku Deployment

For example, you could deploy to Heroku using Docker with the following. This
assumes that you've named your Heroku application "lexicalunit-spellbot" and
have a staging application named "lexicalunit-spellbot-staging".

```shell
# You have to be logged into the Heroku container registry
docker login
heroku login
heroku container:login

# build the image
docker build -t spellbot .

# deploy to staging
docker tag spellbot "registry.heroku.com/lexicalunit-spellbot-staging/web"
docker push "registry.heroku.com/lexicalunit-spellbot-staging/web"
heroku container:release web --app lexicalunit-spellbot-staging

# deploy to production
docker tag spellbot "registry.heroku.com/lexicalunit-spellbot/web"
docker push "registry.heroku.com/lexicalunit-spellbot/web"
heroku container:release web --app lexicalunit-spellbot
```
