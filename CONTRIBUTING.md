# Contributing

This bot is a Python based Discord bot built on top of the [`discord.py`](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library.

It uses [`uv`](usage) to manage dependencies. To install development dependencies use: `uv sync`. This will allow you to run [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and the included scripts.

You can install `uv` with the script [`brew`](https://brew.sh/):

```shell
brew install uv
```

## Installing the application

Install in development mode via `uv`:

```shell
uv sync
```

## Launch Dependencies

SpellBot requires a database to run properly. The connection string for the database you want to use must be stored in the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`.

You can start a local database via Docker by running:

```shell
docker run -i --rm -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust postgres:15
```

Using this locally will allow you to use the default value for `DATABASE_URL` without having to manually set it to anything.

For more details on managing the database, see [our database documentation](./DATABASE.md).

## Running the application

Make sure that you have [set up your environmental variables](/README.md#-running-spellbot-yourself).

If you wish, you can use a [.env file](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/). Copy the `.env.example` file to get started.

When your environmental variables are set, run:

```shell
uv run spellbot --help
```

This will list some useful flags you can provide to run SpellBot. To get started developing, run:

```shell
uv run spellbot --dev
```

This will start SpellBot and reload it whenever the source code changes.

## Running tests

```shell
uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=html
open coverage/index.html
```

## Formatting and linting

Codebase consistency is maintained by [ruff][ruff].

```shell
uv run pytest -k codebase
```

## Interactive Shell

An interactive shell using [IPyhton](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) can be started by running:

```shell
uv run python shell.py
```

From this shell you will be able to interact with the database using SpellBot models and code. For example:

```shell
$ uv run python shell.py

In [1]: DatabaseSession.query(User).all()
Out[1]: []
```

## Release process

There's two methods for doing a release. You can use a script to handle everything for you automatically, or you can basically do every step in that script manually. Both methods are described below but I recommend the script.

### Scripted

To do a release automatically there is a \*NIX script available in the `scripts`
directory to help. To use it you will need to have non-interactive
`uv publish` enabled by running:

```shell
uv publish --token "YOUR-PYPI-TOKEN-GOES-HERE"
```

If you don't have one, you can create your PyPI token for this command by going to the [PyPI settings for spellbot](https://pypi.org/manage/project/spellbot/settings/) and clicking on the `Create a token for spellbot` button there. Of course you will have to be a collaborator for this project on PyPI to be able to do this. Contact [spellbot@lexicalunit.com](mailto:spellbot@lexicalunit.com) to be added to the project.

Once you have that set up, you can release a new version by running:

```shell
scripts/publish.sh <major | minor | patch>
```

You must select either `major`, `minor`, or `patch` as the release kind. Please follow [semver](https://semver.org/) for guidance on what kind of release to make. But basically:

- Major: Breaking changes.
- Minor: New features.
- Patch: Bug fixes.

### Manually

To release a new version of `spellbot`, use `uv`:

```shell
uv version --bump [major|minor|patch]
uv run pytest # verify that all tests pass
# edit the CHANGELOG.md file to promote all unlreased changes to the new version
uv build
git commit -am "Release vM.N.P"
uv publish # you will be prompted for your PyPI login credentials here
git tag 'vM.N.P'
git push --tags origin main
```

> **Note:** The reason you should run `pytest` after running the `uv version`
> command is to ensure that all test still pass after the version is updated.

You can get the `M.N.P` version numbers from `pyproject.toml` after you've run the `uv version` command. On a \*NIX shell you could also get it automatically like so:

```shell
grep "^version" < pyproject.toml | cut -d= -f2 | sed 's/"//g;s/ //g;s/^/v/;'
```

After publishing you can view the package at its [pypi.org project page](https://pypi.org/project/spellbot/) to see that everything looks good.
