# Contributing

This bot is a Python based Discord bot built on top of the
[`discord.py`](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library.

It uses [`poetry`](usage) to manage dependencies. To install development
dependencies use: `poetry install`. This will allow you to run
[PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and the included scripts.

You can install `poetry` with the script `install-poetry.py`:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py | python -
```

## Setting up environment

The easiest thing to do is to set up a virtual python environment specifically for spellbot.

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

Then you can install `poetry` into this environment with:

```shell
.venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
.venv/bin/pip install poetry
```

Now configure `poetry` to use in the virtual environment we already created:

```shell
.venv/bin/poetry config virtualenvs.create false
.venv/bin/poetry env use .venv/bin/python
```

To make this easier I've also included a [`scripts/setup.sh`](scripts/setup.sh)
to do this automatically.

## Installing the application

Install in development mode via `poetry`:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
poetry install
```

> **Note:** On some systems such as most Linux ones you may also need to install
> `python3-venv` using your system's package manager as `poetry` depends on it.

## Launch Dependencies

SpellBot requires a database to run properly. The connection string for the
database you want to use must be stored in the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`.

You can start a local database via Docker by running:

```shell
docker run -i --rm -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust postgres:15
```

Using this locally will allow you to use the default value for `DATABASE_URL`
without having to manually set it to anything.

## Running the application

Make sure that you have [set up your environmental variables](/README.md#-running-spellbot-yourself).

If you wish, you can use a [.env file](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/). Copy the `.env.example` file to get started.

When your environmental variables are set, run:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
poetry run spellbot --help
```

This will list some useful flags you can provide to run SpellBot. To get started developing, run:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
poetry run spellbot --dev
```

This will start SpellBot and reload it whenever the source code changes.

## Running tests

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
poetry run pytest --cov --cov-report=html
open coverage/index.html
```

## Formatting and linting

Codebase consistency is maintained by [ruff][ruff].

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
poetry run pytest -k codebase
```

## Interactive Shell

An interactive shell using [IPyhton](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) can be started by running:

```shell
poetry run python shell.py
```

From this shell you will be able to interact with the database using SpellBot models and code. For example:

```shell
$ poetry run python shell.py

In [1]: DatabaseSession.query(User).all()
Out[1]: []
```

## Release process

There's two methods for doing a release. You can use a script to handle
everything for you automatically, or you can basically do every step in that
script manually. Both methods are described below but I recommend the script.

### Scripted

To do a release automatically there is a \*NIX script available in the `scripts`
directory to help. To use it you will need to have non-interactive
`poetry publish` enabled by running:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
poetry config pypi-token.pypi "YOUR-PYPI-TOKEN-GOES-HERE"
```

If you don't have one, you can create your PyPI token for this command by going
to the
[PyPI settings for spellbot](https://pypi.org/manage/project/spellbot/settings/)
and clicking on the `Create a token for spellbot` button there. Of course you
will have to be a collaborator for this project on PyPI to be able to do this.
Contact [spellbot@lexicalunit.com](mailto:spellbot@lexicalunit.com) to be added
to the project.

Once you have that set up, you can release a new version by running:

```shell
scripts/publish.sh <major | minor | patch>
```

You must select either `major`, `minor`, or `patch` as the release kind. Please
follow [semver](https://semver.org/) for guidance on what kind of release to
make. But basically:

- Major: Breaking changes.
- Minor: New features.
- Patch: Bug fixes.

### Manually

To release a new version of `spellbot`, use `poetry`:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
poetry version [major|minor|patch]
poetry run pytest # verify that all tests pass
# edit the CHANGELOG.md file to promote all unlreased changes to the new version
poetry build
git commit -am "Release vM.N.P"
poetry publish
git tag 'vM.N.P'
git push --tags origin main
```

> **Note:** The reason you should run `pytest` after running the `poetry version`
> command is to ensure that all test still pass after the version is updated.

You can get the `M.N.P` version numbers from `pyproject.toml` after you've run
the `poetry version` command. On a \*NIX shell you could also get it automatically like so:

```shell
grep "^version" < pyproject.toml | cut -d= -f2 | sed 's/"//g;s/ //g;s/^/v/;'
```

When you use the `poetry publish` command you will be prompted for your
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/) credentials.

After publishing you can view the package at its
[pypi.org project page](https://pypi.org/project/spellbot/) to see that
everything looks good.

## Database migrations

We use [alembic][alembic] for database migrations. It can detect changes you've
made compared to an existing database and generate migration scripts necessary
to apply _and_ reverse those changes. First, make the changes to the data
models. Alembic can detect differences between an existing database and changes
made to the models. To autogenerate migration scripts that will bring the
database inline with the changes you've made to the models, run:

```shell
poetry run scripts/create_db_revision.py \
    "<your-sqlalchemy-database-url>" \
    "<Some description of your changes>"
```

> Note: An example database url: postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/postgres

This will create a revision script in the `src/spellbot/versions/versions`
directory with a name like `REVISIONID_some_description_of_your_changes.py`.
You may have to edit this script manually to ensure that it is correct as
the autogenerate facility of `alembic revision` is not perfect.

### Downgrading

Another migration script is `scripts/downgrade.py` which allows you to pass
a revision string to downgrade to. For example, to undo the last migration
you could run something like:

```shell
poetry run scripts/downgrade.py postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/postgres "-1"
```

## Metrics

SpellBot is set up to integrate with [DataDog][datadog] for system and service
metrics. This requires a few things:

1. [In the container](Dockerfile), we install and configure to run the
   following services:
    - [`dd-agent`][dd-agent]
    - [`trace-agent`][trace-agent]
    - [`process-agent`][process-agent]
1. A source dependency on the python [Datadog APM Client: ddtrace][ddtrace].
1. Instrumentation of code using the [`ddtrace` tracer interface][tracer].
1. A deployment with the correct environment variables to configure `dd-agent`.
    - `DD_API_KEY` = Your DataDog API key.
    - `DD_APP_KEY` = Your DataDog application key.
    - `DD_AGENT_MAJOR_VERSION` = "7"
    - `DD_HOSTNAME` = "spellbot"
    - `DD_ENV` = "dev", "stage", or "prod"
1. A `datadog.yaml` file including the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    apm_config:
      enabled: true
      apm_non_local_traffic: true
    ```

1. When starting the `spellbot` process, start it via `ddtrace-run spellbot`
   so that the APM client hooks are properly installed.

Locally in development you can use the following invocation to quickly spin
up a `dd-agent`. And to set up your environment you should use the `.env` file.

```shell
docker run --rm \
    --name dd-agent \
    -p8125:8125 \
    -p8126:8126 \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
    -v /proc/:/host/proc/:ro \
    -v /sys/fs/cgroup/:/host/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
    -e DD_API_KEY="Your DataDog API key" \
    -e DD_APP_KEY="Your DataDog application key" \
    -e DD_AGENT_MAJOR_VERSION="7" \
    -e DD_SERVICE="spellbot" \
    -e DD_HOSTNAME="localhost" \
    -e DD_ENV="dev" \
    gcr.io/datadoghq/agent:7
```
