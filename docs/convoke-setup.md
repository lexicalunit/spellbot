Here's a look at my setup for playing Magic on [Convoke](https://www.convoke.games/)!

![DSLR camera](/assets/img/dslr.jpg)

I use a Panasonic Lumix DMC-G7K with 4k video support. Attached to that is an Olympus M.Zuiko Digital 25mm F1.8 lens. Then attached to the lens is a K&F CONCEPT 46mm Circular Polarizing Filter to cut down on card glare. This model of DSL requires a dummy battery for wall power so I'm using a Gonine DMW-DCC8 Dummy Battery Kit to power the camera.

The camera is mounted with a Glide Gear DST 50 Multi Mount Overhead Rig. The HDMI cable goes straight into a Guermok Video Capture Card, 4K USB3.0 HDMI to USB C Capture Card and into my macOS laptop.

And the camera is pointed straight down at my beautiful Clackeys (RIP) playmat with [artwork by Magali Villeneuve](https://scryfall.com/card/m19/67/patient-rebuilding).

The microphone there is a Blue Yeti with a Custom Built Shock Mount with Pop Filter (bought off Amazon) and mounted on a simple Boom Arm Stand.
