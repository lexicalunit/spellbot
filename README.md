The Discord bot for [SpellTable][spelltable].

[![add-bot][add-bot-button]][add-bot]

## ü§ñ Using SpellBot

Once you've connected the bot to your server, you can interact with it over
Discord via the following commands in any of the authorized channels. **Keep in
mind that sometimes SpellBot will respond to you via Direct Message to avoid
being too spammy in text channels.**

- `!spellbot help`: Provides detailed help about all of the following commands.
- `!about`: Get information about SpellBot and its creators.

> **Note:** To use the
> [commands for event runners](#%EF%B8%8F-commands-for-event-runners)
> and [commands for admins](#-commands-for-admins), you will need to
> [create a role on your server][create-role] called `SpellBot Admin`
> (capitalization matters). Only users with that role will be able to use those
> commands.

### ‚úã Commands for Players

Just looking to play some games of Magic? These commands are for you!

- `!lfg`: Find or start up a game of Magic: The Gathering!
- `!leave`: Leave any games that you've signed up for.
- `!power`: Set your current power level.
- `!report`: Report the results of the game you just played.
- `!team`: Join one of the teams available on your server.
- `!points`: Find out how many points you currently have.
- `!block`: Block other users from joining your games.
- `!unblock`: Unblock previously blocked users.

When you run the `!lfg` command, SpellBot will post a message for sign ups.

![lfg][lfg]

Other users can react to it with the ‚úã emoji to be added to the game. When the
game is ready, SpellBot will update the message with your SpellTable details.

![ready][ready]

Users can also use the üö´ emoji reaction to leave the game.

### üéüÔ∏è Commands for Event Runners

These commands are intended to be run by SpellBot Admins and help facilitate
online events.

- `!game`: Directly create games for the mentioned users.
- `!event`: Create a bunch of games all at once based on some uploaded data.
- `!begin`: Start an event that you previously created with `!event`.
- `!export`: Export historical game data for your server.

### üëë Commands for Admins

These commands will help you configure SpellBot for your server.

- `!spellbot`: This command allows admins to configure SpellBot for their
               server. It supports the following subcommands:
  - `config`: Just show the current configuration for this server.
  - `channels`: Set the channels SpellBot is allowed to operate within.
  - `prefix`: Set the command prefix for SpellBot in text channels.
  - `links`: Set the privacy level for generated SpellTable links.
  - `spectate`: Add a spectator link to the posts SpellBot makes.
  - `expire`: Set how many minutes before games are expired due to inactivity.
  - `teams`: Sets the teams available on this server.
  - `power`: Turns the power command on or off for this server.
  - `voice`: When on, SpellBot will automatically create voice channels.
  - `tags`: Turn on or off the ability to use tags. Optionally mention specific channels.
  - `queue-time`: Turn on or off average queue time details. Optionally mention specific channels.
  - `smotd`: Set the server message of the day.
  - `cmotd`: Set the message of the day for the channel where you run it.

  - `toggle-verify`: Toggles requirement of verification for a specific channel.
  - `auto-verify`: Set the channels that will trigger user auto verification.

  - `verify-message`: Set the verification message for a specific channel.
  - `voice-category`: Set category for voice channels created by !game.
  - `stats`: Gets some statistics about SpellBot usage on your server.
  - `help`: Get detailed usage help for SpellBot.
- `!verify`: Allows moderators to verify a user on their server.
- `!unverify`: Un-verifies a user for this server.
- `!watch`: Allows moderators to watch a user on their server.
- `!unwatch`: Un-watches a user for this server.

### üõãÔ∏è Ergonomics

SpellBot will always try and assume useful defaults or try to do the right thing
when you give it a command. For example if you use the tag <code>~modern</code>
or other format names when creating a game, it will automatically assume the
correct number of players for you. Hopefully these features are intuitive and
helpful ü§û ‚Äî and if not, [please report bugs and request features][issues]
to your heart's content.

### üé§ Feedback

Thoughts and suggestions? Come join us on the
[SpellTable Discord server][discord-invite]! Please also feel free
to [directly report any bugs][issues] that you encounter.

## üôå Support Me

I'm keeping SpellBot running using my own money but if you like the bot and want
to help me out, please consider [becoming a patron][patreon].

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing

If you'd like to become a part of the SpellBot development community please
first know that we have a documented [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and
then see our [documentation on how to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details
on how to get started.

## üîß Running SpellBot Yourself

First install `spellbot` using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```shell
pip install spellbot
```

Provide your Discord bot token with the environment variable `SPELLBOT_TOKEN`.
As well as your SpellTable API authorization token via `SPELLTABLE_AUTH`.

You can get [your bot token from Discord][discord-bot-docs]. Your bot will
need the following permissions enabled:

- Manage Channels
- Create Instant Invite
- View Channels
- Send Messages
- Manage Messages
- Embed Links
- Read Message History
- Add Reactions

As for the SpellTable API authorization token, you'll have to talk to the
SpellTable developers. Come join us on the
[SpellTable Discord server][spelltable-discord].

By default SpellBot will use sqlite3 as its database. You can however choose to
use another database by providing a [SQLAlchemy Connection URL][db-url]. This
can be done via the `--database-url` command line option or the environment
variable `SPELLBOT_DB_URL`. Note that, at the time of this writing, SpellBot is
only tested against sqlite3 and PostgreSQL.

More usage help can be found by running `spellbot --help`.

## üê≥ Docker Support

You can also run SpellBot via docker. Our image is published to
[lexicalunit/spellbot][docker-hub]. See [our documentation on Docker Support](DOCKER.md) for help
with installing and using it.
