## 📱 Using SpellBot

Once you've connected the bot to your server, you can interact with it over
Discord via the following commands in any of the authorized channels.

- `!help`: Provides detailed help about all of the following commands.
- `!about`: Get information about SpellBot and its creators.

### ✋ Queueing

- `!queue`: Get in line to play some Magic: The Gathering!
- `!leave`: Get out of line; it's the opposite of `!queue`.

### 👑 Administration

- `!spellbot`: Admin subcommands to configure SpellBot for your server.

**Subcommands:**

- `channels`: Set the channels SpellBot is allowed to operate within.
- `prefix`: Set the command prefix for SpellBot in text channels.

## 🤖 Running SpellBot

First install `spellbot` using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```shell
pip install spellbot
```

Provide your Discord bot token with the environment variable `SPELLBOT_TOKEN`.

By default SpellBot will use sqlite3 as its database. You can however choose to
use another database by providing a [SQLAlchemy Connection URL][db-url]. This
can be done via the `--database-url` command line option or the environment
variable `SPELLBOT_DB_URL`. Note that, at the time of this writing, SpellBot is only
tested against sqlite3 and PostgreSQL.

More usage help can be found by running `spellbot --help`.

## 🐳 Docker Support

You can also run SpellBot via docker. See
[our documentation on Docker Support](DOCKER.md) for help.
